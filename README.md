# Twitter DM Bot

This Python script allows you to send direct messages (DMs) to the followers of a target user on Twitter. You can customize the message to promote your Instagram pages or any other content you'd like to share. Please note that using this script for spammy or unethical purposes may violate Twitter's policies and result in consequences.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tweepy library (`pip install tweepy`)

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Obtain your Twitter API credentials by creating a Twitter Developer account and creating a new app.
4. Replace the placeholders in the code (`YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY`, `YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`, `TARGET_USER_ID`, and `YOUR_MESSAGE`) with your actual API credentials and the desired target user ID and message.
5. Save the changes in the script.
